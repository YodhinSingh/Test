I tried to make a game that was simple to play and realistic.
The shark is always moving like in real life and needs to fill his belly to survive.
I had dificulties with getting Visual studio to work and that resulted in a lot of time wasted.
If I had time to improve, I would use better graphics and develop more types of fishes with unique personalities and characteristics. I would also
add power ups to speed the shark up/ slow fish down and negative abilities that would make it harder to collect fish.
I think that would help give personality to the game and make it more enjoyable for kids.
